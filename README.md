# Robotic-arm
Designed a robotic arm(pick and place mechanism) having 6 Degree of freedom.
It has parallel jaw gripper for holding objects. I used 3 Servo motors to control movement in all direction.I also designed a  gear box having high gear reduction ratio to control movement.
It can be controlled using servo controller,arduino or micro controller.

A Robot is a virtually intelligent agent capable of carrying out tasks robotically with the
help of some supervision. Practically, a robot is basically an electro-mechanical machine
that is guided by means of computer and electronic programming. Robots can be
classified as autonomous, semiautonomous and remotely controlled. Robots are widely
used for variety of tasks such as service stations, cleaning drains, and in tasks that are
considered too dangerous to be performed by humans. A robotic arm is a robotic
manipulator, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm
It could be used in pandemic (Covid19) to avoid infection of workers working in quarantine centres and hospitals
