# Robotic-arm
Designed a robotic arm(pick and place mechanism) having 6 Degree of freedom.
It has parallel jaw gripper for holding objects. I used 3 Servo motors to control movement in all direction.I also designed a  gear box having high gear reduction ratio to control movement.
It can be controlled using servo controller,arduino or micro controller.

It could be used in pandemic (Covid19) to avoid infection of workers working in quarantine centres and hospitals
